# Forecasting Consumer Spending in the United States
Time Series Forecasting

Consumer spending, also referred to as personal consumption expenditures (PCE), is the value of the goods and services purchased by, or on the behalf of, U.S. residents. These goods include durable goods (motor vehicles, furnishings and so on)non durable goods (bev- erages, clothing), pharmaceutical and other medical products.

Consumer spending is a key element in economic growth. In the United States, drastic changes consumer spending reflected each time the economy went into recession since 1960. Personal consumption expenditures for durable goods decreased in all but two of the re- cessions while personal consumption expenditures for non-durable goods decreased in four of those recessions (McCully). However, previous recessions prior to 1960, experienced real personal consumption expenditures either increasing during the recession or surpassing its previous peak within 18 months of the start of the recession.

Additionally, consumer spending is an important economic factor because it exhibits a pos- itive relationship with the overall consumer confidence in a nationâ€™s economy. Thus, high levels of consumer spending is associated with High consumer confidence in the economic market. Consumer confidence provides governments and businesses with an analysis on con- sumer perception (Vitez).
The goal of this paper is to use quantitative, statistical/econometric and machine learning methods produce and evaluate consumer spending forecasts.
